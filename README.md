# Welcome to NBA Webscraping!!
# Are you a fan of stats of your favorite NBA players? Well, I am. That's why I decided to scrape a dataset of every NBA's player's stats that are currently playing in the 2023-2024 season. Using Python and the BeautifulSoup library, I am able to figure statistical trends of all of my favorite basketball players. Which NBA players are averaging 20+ points per game? Who is currently averaging a double double? Who leads the leauge in points? Thanks to basketballreference.com, I was able to scrape the statistics and populate it for visualization through Matplotlib. Amazing stuff am I right?
