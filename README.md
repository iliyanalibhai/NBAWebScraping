# Welcome to NBA Webscraping!!

Are you a fan of the stats of your favorite NBA players? Well, so am I!

I've taken the initiative to scrape a dataset containing the statistics of every NBA player currently playing in the 2023-2024 season. Using Python and the BeautifulSoup library, I've been able to uncover statistical trends for all of my favorite basketball players.

Ever wondered which NBA players are averaging 20+ points per game? Curious about who is currently averaging a double-double? Want to know who leads the league in points? Well, you're in the right place!

Thanks to basketballreference.com, I've successfully scraped the statistics and organized them for visualization through Matplotlib. It's amazing what insights we can gather from the world of basketball.
